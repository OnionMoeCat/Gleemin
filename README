Gleemin is a Magic the Gathering expert system, originally created as my dissertation for my CS course at the University of Brighton (the ugliest university in the UK). It is a command-line program meant as an AI research tool rather than entertainment. 

Gleemin is written entirely in the logic programming language Prolog. To run the code here all you need is the Swi-Prolog interpreter (It's free and open source and you can get it from: http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html)

Gleemin includes an AI player programmable with expert knowledge and an interpreter for the game's language (the rules text on the cards). In order to play a card, its text is parsed, then the relevant rules engine predicates are called.

Gleemin is still in alpha, and still crashes occasionally, due to the migration of the code from a proprietary Prolog interpeter to Swi-Prolog. The full Magic: the Gathering rules are not yet implemented, the full cared text grammar is not yet implemented and the AI player is still dumb as all hell.
